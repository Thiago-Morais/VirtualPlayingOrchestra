# What Is Virtual Playing Orchestra?

Virtual Playing Orchestra is a free orchestral sample library, in decent sampler format, that was created to emulate multiple articulations of the solo and section instruments from a full orchestra using the best free samples from [Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra](http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/), [No Budget Orchestra](https://github.com/ssj71/No-Budget-Orchestra), [VSCO2 Community Edition](http://vis.versilstudios.net/vsco-2.html), [University of Iowa](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/), [Philharmonia Orchestra](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music) and extra free samples from [Mattias Westlund](http://mattiaswestlund.net/samples/), author of Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra.

The plan was to start with Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra, add new samples from Mattias Westlund and samples from newly available sources that had recently become available to create what I would like to see from a Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra 2.0.
